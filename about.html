        <p>
          Hi, I'm Ismael Barron, but most people call me Ish. I'm a middle child
          of three brothers and I’m very proud with the people I’m surrounded by
          , they mean everything to me. I’m a student, a part-time worker, and
          someone who loves to explore my hobbies and passions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">My Life & Work</h2>
        <p>
          I run a small construction company with my dad and also work part-time
          at Hertz in the Denver Airport. Being busy with work has taught me a
          lot about responsibility and teamwork.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <ul class="text-start mx-auto" style="max-width: 600px">
          <li>
            I love anime, especially <strong>One Piece</strong> — I even collect
            One Piece stuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building Legos is something I enjoy when I need to relax and focus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mountain biking with friends is one of my favorite ways to stay
            active.
          </li>
          <li>
            Music is really important to me — I enjoy emotional, heartfelt
            songs. Artists I love include
            <strong>Frank Ocean, Dijon,</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’m a practicing Catholic and love spreading the word and sharing my
            faith.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Even though I have a busy life, I always make time for the things and
          people I care about. I like to think I’m lucky to be surrounded by
          amazing friends and family who make life meaningful.
